                <p> This page will show you why the occupation as a software engineer
                    will allow you to enjoy more freedom than in most other domains. <br>
                    Therefore we first are going to define freedom to align on what criteria 
                    can be used to measure the level of freedom. Next we will move on to
                    specify the reasons software engineering enables you to a higher degree of 
                    freedom, including a comparison to other professions. Finally the challenges
                    that this great thing called freedom brings with it are discussed.</p>

                    <p>"Freedom is the state of being free from restraint or from the power of another"</p>

                </div>
                <article>A person has the freedom to do things that will not, in theory or in practice, be prevented by other forces.
                    Outside of the human realm, freedom generally does not have this political or psychological dimension. A rusty lock might 
                    be oiled so that the key has the freedom to turn, undergrowth may be hacked away to give a newly planted sapling 
                    freedom to grow, or a mathematician may study an equation having many degrees of freedom. In physics or engineering, 
                    the mathematical concept may also be applied to a body or system constrained by a set of equations, whose degrees of 
                    freedom describe the number of independent motions that are allowed to it.

                <aside>Personally I stick with the mathematical definition and measure my personal freedom
                    in the number of opportunities and endavors I can undertake to increase my personal happiness.
                    If you want to learn about freedom from a socio-economic perspective I suggest Milton Fiedman's

                <h3>Software Engineering</h3>
                <article>Software engineers enjoy freedom in a simple sense because they are able to work on a variety of projects, and in a variety of industries and sectors. 
                    They are also able to work from home, or from anywhere in the world, as long as they have a computer and an internet connection. 
                    In a broader sense to me the fact that as a software engineer you are able to <em>create</em> products appears to be significant.
                    In this act of creation you enjoy the freedom of self-fulfilment, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs">Maslow</a> 
                    the highest need humans can accomplish to satisfy.

                    <article>The point I want to stress here is the effect of leverage. Let's jump back 5 decades in time, where leverage
                        from a business perspective required <em>permission</em>, in the sense that capital as well as employees have to be given to you
                        in the first place.  In todays modern world we are blessed with two kinds of permissionless leverage that are <strong>code and media</strong>.
                        The age of digitalization creates an audience for almost every product you can imagine no matter how narrow the niche is
                    </article>
                    <article>To sum up, software engineers enjoy the combination of being able to express your creativity in products and use the 
                        using the internet as leverage to reach a global audience. It's been already proven how easy a small script of code can 
                        change the world.

                <h3>Challenges that come with Freedom</h3>
                <article>While freedom is a great thing, it does pose some challenges. The existence of a plethora of options can be 
                    overwhealming, for example it can be difficult to stay motivated when working from home, 
                    or to stay focused on one project when there are so many other interesting things to work on.</article>
                <article>From personal experience I can verify how difficult it can be to distinguish between all the things you <strong>can</strong>
                    do and the things you really <strong>want</strong> to do.
