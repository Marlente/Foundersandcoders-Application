                <p> This page will show you why the occupation as a software engineer
                    will allow you to enjoy more freedom than in most other domains. <br>
                    Therefore we first are going to define freedom to align on what criteria 
                    can be used to measure the level of freedom. Next we will move on to
                    specify the reasons software engineering enables you to a higher degree of 
                    freedom, including a comparison to other professions. Finally the challenges
                    that this great thing called freedom brings with it are discussed.</p>

                <h3>What is Freedom?</h3>
                <div class="cite">
                    <p>"Freedom is the state of being free from restraint or from the power of another"</p>

                </div>
                <article>A person has the freedom to do things that will not, in theory or in practice, be prevented by other forces.
                    Outside of the human realm, freedom generally does not have this political or psychological dimension. A rusty lock might 
                    be oiled so that the key has the freedom to turn, undergrowth may be hacked away to give a newly planted sapling 
                    freedom to grow, or a mathematician may study an equation having many degrees of freedom. In physics or engineering, 
                    the mathematical concept may also be applied to a body or system constrained by a set of equations, whose degrees of 
                    freedom describe the number of independent motions that are allowed to it.

                <aside>Personally I stick with the mathematical definition and measure my personal freedom
                    in the number of opportunities and endavors I can undertake to increase my personal happiness.
                    If you want to learn about freedom from a socio-economic perspective I suggest

                <h3>Software Engineering</h3>
                <p>Software engineers enjoy freedom because they are able to work on a variety of projects, in a variety of industries and sectors. 
                    They are also able to work from home, or from anywhere in the world, as long as they have a computer and an internet connection. </p>

                <h3>Challenges that come with Freedom</h3>
                <p>While freedom is a great thing, it does pose some challenges. For example, it can be difficult to stay motivated when working from home, 
                    or to stay focused on one project when there are so many other interesting things to work on.</p>
